Project Overview
================

OpenACD is an opensource project aimed at providing a distributed, fault
tolerant contact/call center platform. It's implemented in
[Erlang](http://erlang.org), uses [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org) for
its web UI and integrates tightly with [FreeSWITCH](http://freeswitch.org)
for its VoIP components. The sister project
[gen_smtp](http://github.com/Vagabond/gen_smtp) is used for email support.

Feature Highlights
==================

+ Skill based routing
+ Priority and unified queueing
+ Web-based administration and agent interaction
+ Supervisory interface for managing agents/call flow
+ Support for handling voice calls (inbound and outbound), voicemails and emails
+ Detailed CDRs and agent state recording
+ Extensible architecture for new media types, data collection, and agent interaction

Participants
============

Development is sponsored by [KGB](http://kgb.com) and
the 2 main developers are:

Other contributions are welcome.

You can also (possibly) get help on IRC via #openacd on FreeNode.

A mailinglist also exists at http://groups.google.com/group/openacd/

Contributing
============

If you'd like to contribute - simply make a fork on github, and once you've got
some changes you like reviewed, send a pull request or email to either of the
main developers. We'll review the changes and either include them or let you
know why not. Also feel free to contribute documentation, translations or report bugs.

Project Status
==============

OpenACD current exists in two states:  version 1.0 which features all the
above, and version 2.0, which adds multi-channel, and improved plugin 
support.  For the stable version 1.0, use the 'v1' branch.  Master is 
version 2, and is in heavy development.

There are also two branches to help when developing plugins:
embeddable_build and embeddable_build_v1.  They correspond to master and
v1 respectively.  When developing a plugin using rebar to build, using
the embeddable_build and embeddable_build_v1 will ensure OpenACD builds 
properly and gives the developer no trouble.

The OpenACD developers are working with [eZuce](http://www.ezuce.com) and 
[KGB](http://kgb.com) to integrate OpenACD as the new sipXecs ACD.
