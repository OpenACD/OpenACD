Project Overview
================

OpenACD is an opensource project aimed at providing a distributed, fault
tolerant contact/call center platform. It's implemented in
[Erlang](http://erlang.org), uses [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org) for
its web UI and integrates tightly with [FreeSWITCH](http://freeswitch.org) for
its VoIP components. The sister project
[gen_smtp](http://github.com/Vagabond/gen_smtp) is used for email support.

Feature Highlights
==================

+ Skill based routing
+ Priority and unified queueing
+ Web-based administration and agent interaction
+ Supervisory drag and drop interface for managing agents/call flow
+ Support for handling voice calls (inbound and outbound), voicemails and emails
+ Detailed CDRs and agent state recording

Participants
============

Development is sponsored by [Fused Solutions](http://www.fusedsolutions.com) and
the 2 main developers are:

+ Andrew Thompson (andrew@hijacked.us)
+ Micah Warren (micahw@fusedsolutions.com)

Other contributions are welcome.

Contributing
============

If you'd like to contribute - simply make a fork on github, and once you've got
some changes you like reviewed, send a pull request or email to either of the
main developers. We'll review the changes and either include them or let you
know why not. Also feel free to contribute documentation, translations or report bugs.

Project Status
==============

The project is approaching a 1.0 release (which indicates that Fused Solutions
will be able to use it internally). We expect to have the 1.0 milestone reached
by late March 2010. After 1.0 we intend to add more features such as chat
support and the ability for an agent to handle more than one email/chat
simultaneously.
